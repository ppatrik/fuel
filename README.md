## Description

**FuelPHP** is a fast, lightweight PHP 5.3+ framework. In an age where frameworks are a dime a dozen, We believe that FuelPHP will stand out in the crowd.  It will do this by combining all the things you love about the great frameworks out there, while getting rid of the bad.

FuelPHP is fully PHP 7 compatible.

**Propel2** is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for PHP 5.5 and up.

## More information

This FuelPHP Skeleton project combines FuelPHP framework with popular [Propel2](http://propelorm.org).
Tables are implemented in files `fuel/propel/tables/(*.)schema.xml` according to [docs](http://propelorm.org/documentation/reference/schema.html).

You can use traditional propel commands approach or use pre written scripts:
   
   * `composer run-script propel-model-build` - automated model builds
   * `composer run-script propel-diff` - automated model and database diff
   * `composer run-script propel-migration-up` - migrate database up 
   * `composer run-script propel-migration-down` - migrate database down 

For more detailed information, see the [development wiki](https://github.com/fuelphp/fuelphp/wiki).
